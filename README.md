## Introduction
I1820 platform agent library with LAN protocol and Aolab model.
you can use this library in order to implement application that sends and receives data by LAN protocol
and based on Aolab model with I1820. This library in python so it will be easy to use it on Raspberry Pi.

## Projects
### Goldoon
- Author: Iman Tabrizian

This project provides soild humidity measurement with I1820.
ESP sends it's data to RPi and RPi acts as a gateway and sends
the data to I1820 brain.

### Green House
- Author: Behnaz Sadat Motevali

This project controls your green house water and humdity with zigbees.
zigbees send their data to RPi and RPi acts as a gateway and sends
the data to I1820 brain.

### AoLab
- Author: Field Team of AoLab.

This project is a our main goal of creating this platform.
In this project we connect the RPi to nRF network and it acts like
a gateway and we can control the lamps or read the sensors.
